# Natural Language Processing | Summer 2023 - Winter 2024
This is the repository for some of the research assistant work done at Nanjing University from Summer 2023 to Winter 2024. The related programming work was implemented using Python NumPy & Keras. Other research work involved data collection, data cleaning, and analysis. Please feel free to email me at rd2910@nyu.edu for any more information. 

### Text Classification
The /text_classification directory contains the training and prediction using the Hierarchical Attention Network model on different datasets. This part of the work aimed to explore the effectiveness of classification models for future research.
