# Natural Language Processing | Summer 2023
This is the repository for the text classification project done during Summer 2023. This project uses the HAN network for training and classification. Most of the programming and tidying work were done through Python Keras & NumPy, and the dataset is IMDB movie reviews from Kaggle. The accuracy of the best model is over 80%. More details can be found under the /best_model/ directory. Please feel free to email me at rd2910@nyu.edu for any more information.
